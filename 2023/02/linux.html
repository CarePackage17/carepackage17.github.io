        <h1 id="postTitle">Giving Linux another try</h1>
        <p>
            In recent times I decided to give Linux another try after using Windows for the past 5 or so years.<br>
            It's not the first time, but there was always reasons for me to go back, be it games, tools or
            familiarity/nostalgia after having started my journey with computers with Windows 95 and my
            journey as a programmer with Windows Phone 7 and C#.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's definitely interesting.<br>
            What I noticed immediately is that some things are just <em>faster</em>.<br>
            On my desktop machine it's not that much of a difference; but my laptop is old (~7 years) so I notice
            it a lot on there.<br>
            Interestingly, this is the first time I was able to use Linux on my laptop; every time I tried before
            (the last time being around 2018 IIRC) it had a bug where the display brightness would be 100%
            at all times and could not be regulated out of the box.<br>
            Needless to say, I did not have the skill (nor the interest) to investigate this bug myself, so I
            went back to Windows and got on with my life for a couple of years.<br>
            Today on Ubuntu 22.10 that bug does not exist anymore, so I can finally run Linux without hurting
            my eyes (yay ðŸ˜Š).
        </p>
        <p>
            There's still things that <q>just work</q> on Windows (such as hardware video acceleration) where
            you might have to jump through hoops to get working on Linux. It doesn't help that my laptop
            has a Nvidia GPU, which currently have somewhat worse integration with other Linux software compared to
            Intel and AMD, both of which provide open-source drivers for their GPUs.
        </p>
        <h2>Tools</h2>
        <h3>Unity</h3>
        <p>
            I've been doing some Unity development before switching OS, so I expected some friction there.
            Since 2021 LTS there is an officially supported Linux Editor, though only for an older Ubuntu
            version. Some hacks were required to get it to run on Ubuntu 22.10, but it's been
            working ever since.
        </p>
        <h3>Debugging</h3>
        <p>
            There is support for debugging Unity projects via <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a> on
            Linux...but the official plugin for that is effectively deprecated and broken.<br>
            Rider exists, but since it's just for hobby development, I'm not willing to pay a subscription
            for an IDE, however good it might be.<br>
            I was able to find <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=deitry.unity-debug">a
                maintained fork</a> of the debugging extension and it seems to work for now, although the experience
            with VS 2022 on Windows is superior.<br>
            Yeah, the comparison is unfair, I know...<br>
            I do expect things to get better as soon as
            <a href="https://blog.unity.com/technology/unity-and-net-whats-next">Unity migrates to CoreCLR</a>,
            and I'm very much looking forward to that.
        </p>
        <h2>Games</h2>
        <h3>Apex Legends</h3>
        <p>
            Apex seems to be running nicely (on my desktop at least) after figuring out that for some reason
            the anti-cheat software it uses needs to separately installed via Steam.<br>
            Very cool that it works, though. ðŸ˜„
        </p>
        <h2>Other</h2>
        <p>
            Two-finger touchpad scrolling is kinda janky in Firefox compared to builtin apps like Settings.<br>
            I've read some stuff that there is work underway or some workarounds, but haven't bothered
            to investigate it further yet.
        </p>
        <p>
            Laptop battery life is worse than on Windows, although it wasn't ever good to begin with.<br>
            I have made no measurements, but it feels to be around 60-70% of Windows battery life depending
            on the workload (VS Code, Web browsing, Video playback being the most common things).
        </p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            I'm curious where this experiment will take me.<br>
            Looking forward to Unity improving their Linux support, plus how the kernel itself is going to evolve
            with the addition of <a href="https://github.com/Rust-for-Linux/linux">Rust</a> going forward.<br>
            It definitely feels nice that my old laptop is getting a second life of sorts.
        </p>

            Alright then...see you next time. ðŸ˜Š
