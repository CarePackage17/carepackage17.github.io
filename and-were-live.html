                This is now hosted - at the time of writing - on GitHub Pages. Mostly because:
                <ul>
                    <li>I had a GitHub account already</li>
                    <li>I wanted source control for all my website stuff anyway</li>
                    <li>It was as easy as it gets to set up (also because I had an old site lying around there, but shhh...)</li>
                    <li>I didn't want to trawl the web searching for hosting providers (which I know nothing about)</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                So far I was just previewing stuff in the browser, locally. Not even from a development server, just
                opening files in a browser.<br>
                What did that change?
            </p>
            <p>First of all, it broke the last-modified date on each post.</p>
            <p>
                Locally it's just filesystem-level timestamps, but those are gone when uploading to GitHub...and then, when
                it deploys the site itself, all of the files are touched again and end up with the same timestamp.<br>
                So I guess I'll delete that footer for now until I'm motivated to bring it back in some form.
            </p>
            <p>
                Secondly, publishing enables me to easily test the site on my mobile device, which is nice because I want
                it to be usable there as well. :)
            </p>
            <p>Alright then, let's see how this goes.<br>See you next time.</p>
