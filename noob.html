            <p>
                I've been programming for a while now, but haven't had much interest in web development so far. 
                Maybe dabbled a bit, but never got around to playing with it for longer than a few weeks maybe.<br>
                Anyway, I wanna approach this with a beginner's mindset.
            </p>
            <p>
                Watching from the sidelines as a programmer who's been mostly doing C# and C++ over the years, the web
                dev world looks like there's lots of churn. Frameworks, tools and other stuff; it looks quite hard
                to stay current with what's happening.<br>
                So I consciously decide to stay away from that for the time being.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'll be doing very basic stuff. Just HTML and CSS with very minimal scripting for now.<br>
                I think it'll be very readable in "view source" mode.
            </p>
            <p>
                It won't be pretty at the start; probably quite the opposite. But I think being willing to suck, not
                overwhelming myself with choices and choosing a subtopic I'm at least slightly interested in makes
                learning easier.<br>
                I want to find something that is fun when learning. There's enough chores in life and I've head enough
                of <em>"learning"</em> just for <em>"an exam"</em> type of bullshit.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                If it's not fun, I don't intend on taking it much further. I've forced myself to do stuff for far too long
                and it never brought me things that really matter: joy and peace of mind.<br>
                That's what I'll be looking for in this journey.
            </p>
            <p>
                One thing I haven't decided on yet; whether I'll be updating old pages when learning something new.<br>
                Like applying a nice font for example, which I wanna do in the future.
            </p>
            <p>
                If I didn't, progress would be much more visible.
            </p>
            <p>
                If I did, everything would look nicer and more consistent, so reading old posts when the main page
                changed would be less jarring.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyway, I guess I'll decide that at a later point.<br>
                See you next time.
