        <p>
            That might be a valid question to ask when some time has passed.<br>
            Before today there was no way to tell (unless you looked in the git repo when I added a file).
        </p>
        <p>
            This is now possible, though I'm doing it manually, like this:
            <ul>
                <li>There's a folder for every year</li>
                <li>There's a subfolder for every month where I put the posts (HTML files)</li>
                <li>I manually write a month header before every post listing on the main page</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Might not scale, but I don't care. Right now I'm the only one publishing stuff here and my patience
            (or lack thereof) is the only thing that's driving change.<br>
            I don't want to force change.
        </p>
        <p>I want to explore and play.</p>
        <aside>
            Side note: Moving previous posts into the new folder structure will break links. CSS even broke for this post,
            as my workflow is copy-pasting the previous one and deleting the content, then writing some stuff.
