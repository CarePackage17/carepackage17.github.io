        <h1 id="postTitle">It's been a while...</h1>
        <p>
            It looks like I dropped the ball on writing pretty hard. Well, life happens.<br>
            Where are we right now?
        </p>
        <p>
            At the moment I'm not too interested in doing HTML stuff.<br>
            Then again, I'm very hungry in this instant and my pizza delivery is taking longer than expected. Oof.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've started watching more speedruns during the course of the year: specifically <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/gymnast86">this guy</a>.
            He's running Zelda games I played as a kid (except for Wind Waker, that one I played later).<br>
            I'm not interested in replaying them myself again (even if my last playthrough was long ago), but watching somebody run 
            through the game with lots of weird glitches and the like is very entertaining.
        </p>
        <p>
            What else?<br>
            Unity released <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.entities@1.0/manual/index.html">Entites 1.0 preview</a> recently and I've
            gone through one of the tutorials a bit.<br>
            It looks very interesting, and very much unlike Unity. The performance results look promising, but I haven't done anything 
            <em>serious</em> or work-related with that yet; just checking out what this is all about.<br>
            Definitely looking forward to 1.0 proper. Unfortunately lots of time will pass until I can use that stuff at work, i.e. 2 major LTS upgrades. :(
        </p>
        <aside>
            I'm very glad my pizza arrived shortly after writing the above paragraph about Unity.<br>
            It was very nice, I might order at that place again in the future.

            It looks like I can use basic web features, such as hyperlinks, as demonstrated by this post.<br>
            I would've been a good web developer in the 90s.
            This basic-ass site might even work in some version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer">IE</a>.

        <h3>What is this incoherent rambling?</h3>
        <p>
            I guess it's being a human with lots of thoughts on their mind. Or ADD. Or both. Who knows.<br>
            Sometimes I wish we'd live in times and/or a society that gave a shit about human beings instead of being about money
            and power and bullshit.<br>
            I know this is not what I want, yet I need to somewhat participate to sustain myself.<br>
            
        </p>
        <p>
            I wish I could just be. With and without others.<br>
            Without bullshit expectations and without having to prove my "worth" to somebody (who doesn't get any of this anyway).<br>
            Is this the <em>freedom</em> that people have been talking about since the dawn of time?
