            <h1>Hi.</h1>
            This is my website. Welcome. :)
            <p>
                I'll be writing some stuff here. Sometimes about programming, sometimes about life.<br>
                In any case, it's meant to be my spot on the public internet, a place to write down my thoughts.
            </p>
            <p>
                Right now it's pretty empty, there's only words for now.<br>
                No fancy logo, no hamburger menu, no blinky lights. Nothing except words. 
                In spirit, it's pretty much like <a href="https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">this one</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyway, this is it for now. I'll be thinking a bit how I want to structure the next page and how to link from
                here (or to here since that's meant as a first post kinda thing).<br>
                See you next time.
            </p>

    <script>
        //For some reason querySelector returns null here. I guess I'll find out in the future why that is.
        let lastModifiedElement = document.getElementById('lastModified');
        lastModifiedElement.innerHTML += document.lastModified;
    </script>
