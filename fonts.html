            <p>
                The default font so far is not my favorite. While perfectly readable, I don't think it's very pretty
                 and it gives me that Windows 98 WordPad kind of vibe.<br>
                Let's change it.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/font">HTML &lt;font&gt; tag</a>, but
                apparently it's deprecated in favor of using CSS, so let's do that.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is what <code>sans-serif</code> looks like. Better, but not sure I wanna keep it for long.<br>
                There is no "standard list of fonts guaranteed everywhere" kind of thing, at least not in the HTML standard.
                For consistency, I could include an external font. Otherwise using generic categories like <code>sans-serif</code>
                also gives some broad direction that should at least look similar across browsers/operating systems.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alright, so now we ditched the 90s style for the 2000s (I guess) and included our first CSS file.<br>
                I assume we'll use more CSS for making stuff pretty going forward.
            </p>
            <p>Also, italic font for the last modified date; isn't it pretty? :)</p>
            <footer id="lastModified">
                Last modified on: 
            </footer>
        </article>
    </body>

    <script>
        let lastModifiedElement = document.getElementById('lastModified');
        lastModifiedElement.innerHTML += document.lastModified;

        let titleElement = document.getElementById('postTitle');
        document.title += ' ' + titleElement.innerHTML;
    </script>
